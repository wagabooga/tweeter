# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Using HTML, CSS, JS, Jquery, and AJAX front-end skills I have turned the starter code into a functional website.

In the future I wish to add the following features
- Functional header button
- Working Flag, RT, and like system
- Customizable Profiles



## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
2. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
3. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above
- md5: 2.1.0 or above
- chance: 1.0.2 or above
